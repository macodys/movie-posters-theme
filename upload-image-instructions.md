## Steps to upload your image:

1. **Rename your image file** from:

2. **Copy the renamed file** to this location:
   `/Users/michaelodysseos/movie-posters-theme-github/assets/neon-gamepad-glow.png`

3. **The CSS is already updated** to use this new image for the Games button (second poster card)

## Alternative: If you want to keep the original filename

If you prefer to keep the original filename, I can update the CSS to use:
`20250909_1913_Neon Gamepad Glow_remix_01k4qkxxfxf0tvpaxahs37nzpw.png`

Just let me know and I'll update the CSS accordingly.
